Hello! 
This is a basic Pomodoro Timer.
Pomodoro Timer is a very popular time mangement method used by many students.


How it works is there is a 25 minute interval divided up by breaks.
I divided this one up by three section to make it a total of 75 minutes.
The break is five minute long. 

This is all pogrammed using Javascript, html and css.
